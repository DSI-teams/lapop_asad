`All Files/3 Data Playground Dashboard/Team_1/Datasets`

Started at the above location and looked up each country using it's full name **exactly** as listed in the `Country` column.

Filtered such by searching within `File and Folder Names` **only**.

------

A few things to note:

- Some of the individual year datasets didn't seem to be present on box as indicated by the `years on box` column but in **most** cases the merged dataset includes those missing years.
- `Additional` files are those not included in the search results. Some were missing because country names were abbreviated or spelled differently in the file name.
- Some `Additional` files seem to be multiple versions of similar (same?) files like the Core Questionnaire, for example.
- The grand total listed in the Excel sheet (162) is **not** the same number as that listed on box for the total number of files in the path mentioned above (151). So, it is likely this manual method of checking counted some files more than once. The priority was not so much the additional files but getting a sense of the core `.dta` files and years covered which should (hopefully) be correct.
